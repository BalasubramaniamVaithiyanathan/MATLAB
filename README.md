German Grading System Simulation

Overview

This MATLAB-based project simulates a grading system following the German academic evaluation standards. It converts performance scores into grades using a mathematical function and visualizes the grading distribution.

Features

-Converts raw performance scores to grades (1.0 - 5.0) based on a predefined formula.

-Ensures fail grades (n > 4.0) are assigned a 5.0.

-Maintains a minimum grade of 1.0.

-Provides visual representation using MATLAB plots.

-Implements both loop-based and vectorized approaches for efficiency.

Installation

-Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.

-Clone this repository using:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/German-Grading-System.git

-Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned directory.
